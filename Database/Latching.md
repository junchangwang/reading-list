#### Optimistic Locking

* **[SYW23, OptQL]** Ge Shi, Ziyi Yan, Tianzheng Wang. "**OptiQL: Robust Optimistic Locking for Memory-Optimized Indexes**". In SIGMOD'23.
  - The authors proposed a locking mechanism that fundamentally orchastrates MCS lock and queue-based lock. OptiQL is specifically designed for optimistic locking in DBMSs, distinguishing it fundamentally from other locking designs (e.g., the mutex lock in the Linux kernel).
